# Issues
TODO: Aliases will not work with sudo.

TODO: Vim configuration is broken with sudo but not with actual root.

# Maintanance
TODO: Move zsh plugins from pacman to a standalone package manager.

**Rationale**: To rely on pacman is bad as it only have some plugins in its repo and that will lead me to use AUR which is worse than installing from git using a dedicated package manager. Additionaly I can easily reuse my dotfiles in any distro because they will be independent from package manager.


# Features
TODO: Make better use of broot and nerdtree.

**Rationale**: File navigation is currently sucking.
