# Issues
TODO: Aliases will not work with sudo.


# Maintanance
TODO: Move zsh plugins from pacman to a standalone package manager.

**Rationale**: To rely on pacman for this task is bad as it only have some plugins in its repo and that will lead me to use AUR which is worse than installing from git using a dedicated package manager. Additionaly I can easily reuse my dotfiles in any distro because they will be independent from package manager.


# Features

None planned.
