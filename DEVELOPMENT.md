# Discussion
Package management fragmentation is bad but Arch repos aren't enough for Vim plugins and I don't want to use the AUR when I can safely and easily update my plugins directly from their git repos. For Zsh Arch repos are fine. Using niche package managers like those for Vim and Zsh have an advantage, I can easily replicate my environment in any Linux distro even if I don't have superuser privileges.
