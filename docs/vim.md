| m[a-Z]   | set up a mark in the cursor position          |
| y'[a-]Z  | yank at mark position (could be any movement) |
| '[a-Z]   | jump to mark line beginning                   |

*' and \` have similar behaviors, but the first jumps to beginning of line while the later go to cursor position.*

| sequence   | behavior                                  |
| ---        | ---                                       |
| "[a-Z]verb | store/read from different memory register |

## Special
- `+`   start vi/vim at a specific line and can be used with expressions.
- `vi +'/foo/d|wq!' ~/.ssh/known_hosts` remove an entry from SSH know hosts

### Undo, redo and repeat

| ---     | ---                     |
| u       | undo                    |
| C^R     | redo                    |
| .       | repeats last change     |
| @:      | repeats last command    |

## Splits and Tabs
| action      | behavior                         |
| ---         | ---                              |
| :sp         | open horizontal split            |
| :vsp        | open vertical split              |
| :tabnew     | open new tab                     |
| C^{h,j,k,l} | navigate between splits (custom) |
| C^w{+-=}    | resize splits                    |
| C^wT        | convert split to tab             |
| gt          | switch between tabs              |


## Folds
| action | behavior              |
| ---    | ---                   |
| zf     | create fold           |
| zd     | delete fold           |
| zo     | open fold             |
| zc     | close fold            |
| za     | toggle fold           |
| zO     | open all under cursor |
| zR     | open all              |

## Search
| action | behavior        |
| ---    | ---             |
| \      | search          |
| n or * | next result     |
| N or # | previous result |

### Regex replace
- one line:          `:s/foo/bar/g`
- all lines:         `:%s/foo/bar/g`
- specific lines:    `:1,10s/foo/bar/g`
- specific markers:  `:'b,'ds/foo/bar/g`
- global:            `:%g/foo/s/bar/zzz/g` (in every line containing 'foo' substitute 'bar' by 'zzz')
- converse-global:   `:%v/foo/s/bar/zzz/g` (in every line not containing)
- from shell:        `vim -c '%s/orig-pattern/new-pattern/gc' filename.txt`

*To replace with new lines use `\r` instead of `\n`. Substituting by `\n` inserts a null character into the text while `\r` inserts a new line by inputting a carriage return. When searching for a newline, youâ€™d still use `\n`, however.*

[Tutorial: search and replace](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace)

## Macros
| action | behavior                      |

| @@     | execute last macro            |

## Plugin Management
[Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

## Checking
### Spell checking
- \en      toggle spell checking for english (custom)
- \pt      toggle spell checking for portuguese (custom)

*note: red are errors while cyan are wrong regionalisms.*
*eg: behavior is correct in en-us while en-gb uses behaviour.*

Toggle for specific language:
`setlocal spell spellang=en_us`

### Syntax checking
[ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) stands for Asynchronous Lite Engine
- C^b   jump to previous linting warning
- C^e   jump to next linting warning

Ale uses whatever is installed in the system.
Check [ale/supported-tools.md](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/blob/master/supported-tools.md).

## Version control
### Vimdiff
| action            | behavior             |
| ---               | ---                  |
| do                | get chunk of changes |
| dp                | put chunk of changes |
| :diffget LO or dh | get from LOCAL       |
| :diffget BA       | get from BASE        |
| :diffget RE or dl | get from REMOTE      |

Use vimdiff to solver merge conflicts:
```sh
git mergetool --prompt -t nvimdiff
```

- It will stage file on close and without `prompt` will open a new file automatically until all are reviewed
- Use `:cquit` to abort
- To exit normally use `:wqa`

| :diffget //2   | use chunk from the left buffer at working              |

| :diffput or dp | put chunk on working (fugitive)                        |

### Tabularize
[Tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular) is a script for text alignment.

#### Usage
`:Tabularize /$1 /$2`

Where `$1` is the place holder string and `$2` format options lke l1c1r1 where l, r, c are
left, right and center and the numbers refers to desired whitespaces for each.

When invoked without selection will consider the paragraph as its scope.

`\zs` is the zero-width â€˜pattern startâ€™ search atom. I don't know exactly what it does but when used as `:Tabularize:\zs` it will use `:` as delimiter but not space it.

#### Patterns
- Save: `:AddTabularPattern first_comma /^[^,]\zs,/r0c0l0`
- Invoke: `:Tabularize first_comma` 

Check its [documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godlygeek/tabular/master/doc/Tabular.txt).

## Scripts
While using maps beware of the danger of recursion. Always use noremaps.
